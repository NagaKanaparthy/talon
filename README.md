#TALON
This is the repository for the University of North Florida's TALON Autonomous Underwater Robot. We are currently running Ubuntu 14.04, and ROS Indigo. 

## ROS Package Naming
ROS packages should be named in the format ```talon_<descriptive name>``` and should only contain numbers, letters, and underscores.
